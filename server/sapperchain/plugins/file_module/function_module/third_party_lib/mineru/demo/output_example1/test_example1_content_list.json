This content is extremely valuable for systems such as search engines, Knowledge Graph’s, etc, since they enhance their predictive capabilities. Unfortunately, tables come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. Furthermore, they can have complex column/row-header configurations, multiline rows, different variety of separation lines, missing entries, etc. As such, the correct identification of the table-structure from an image is a nontrivial task. In this paper, we present a new table-structure identification model. The latter improves the latest end-toend deep learning model (i.e. encoder-dual-decoder from PubTabNet) in two significant ways. First, we introduce a new object detection decoder for table-cells. In this way, we can obtain the content of the table-cells from programmatic PDF’s directly from the PDF source and avoid the training of the custom OCR decoders. This architectural change leads to more accurate table-content extraction and allows us to tackle non-english tables. Second, we replace the LSTM decoders with transformer based decoders. This upgrade improves significantly the previous state-of-the-art tree-editing-distance-score (TEDS) from $91\\%$ to $98.5\\%$ on simple tables and from $88.7\\%$ to $95\\%$ on complex tables. ",

This is especially true for complex column- and row headers, which can be extremely intricate and demanding. A second factor of complexity is the lack of data with regard to table-structure. Until the publication of PubTabNet [37], there were no large datasets (i.e. $>100\\mathrm{K}$ tables) that provided structure information. This happens primarily due to the fact that tables are notoriously time-consuming to annotate by hand.

Such sequences of tokens can be HTML table tags [37, 17] or LaTeX symbols[10]. The choice of symbols is ultimately not very important, since one can be transformed into the other. There are however subtle variations in the Image-to-Text networks. The easiest network architectures are “image-encoder $\\rightarrow$ text-decoder” (IETD), similar to network architectures that try to provide captions to images [32]. In these IETD networks, one expects as output the LaTeX/HTML string of the entire table, i.e. the symbols necessary for creating the table with the content of the table. Another approach is the “image-encoder $\\rightarrow$ dual decoder” (IEDD) networks. In these type of networks, one has two consecutive decoders with different purposes. The first decoder is the tag-decoder, i.e. it only produces the HTML/LaTeX tags which construct an empty table. The second content-decoder uses the encoding of the image in combination with the output encoding of each cell-tag (from the tag-decoder) to generate the textual content of each table cell. The network architecture of IEDD is certainly more elaborate, but it has the advantage that one can pre-train the tag-decoder which is constrained to the table-tags. ",

This reliance on a custom, implicit OCR decoder is of course problematic. OCR is a well known and extremely tough problem, that often needs custom training for each individual language. However, the limited availability for non-english content in the current datasets, makes it impractical to apply the IETD and IEDD methods on tables with other languages. Additionally, OCR can be completely omitted if the tables originate from programmatic PDF documents with known positions of each cell. The latter was the inspiration for the work of this paper. ",

Each node is then associated with en embedding vector coming from the encoded image, its coordinates and the encoded text. Furthermore, nodes that represent adjacent text-cells are linked. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN’s) based methods take the image as an input, but also the position of the text-cells and their content [18]. The purpose of a GCN is to transform the input graph into a new graph, which replaces the old links with new ones. The new links then represent the table-structure. With this approach, one can avoid the need to build custom OCR decoders. However, the quality of the reconstructed structure is not comparable to the current state-of-the-art [18]. ",

A table is considered to be simple if it does not contain row spans or column spans. Additionally, a table has a strict HTML structure if every row has the same number of columns after taking into account any row or column spans. Therefore a strict HTML structure looks always rectangular. However, HTML is a lenient encoding format, i.e. tables with rows of different sizes might still be regarded as correct due to implicit display rules. These implicit rules leave room for ambiguity, which we want to avoid. As such, we prefer to have ”strict” tables, i.e. tables where every row has exactly the same length. ",

As a first step, we use the annotation data to generate the most fine-grained grid that covers the table structure. In case of strict HTML tables, all grid squares are associated with some table cell and in the presence of table spans a cell extends across multiple grid squares. When enough bounding boxes are known for a rectangular table, it is possible to compute the geometrical border lines between the grid rows and columns. Eventually this information is used to generate the missing bounding boxes. Additionally, the existence of unused grid squares indicates that the table rows have unequal number of columns and the overall structure is non-strict. The generation of missing bounding boxes for non-strict HTML tables is ambiguous and therefore quite challenging. Thus, we have decided to simply discard those tables. In case of PubTabNet we have computed missing bounding boxes for $48\\%$ of the simple and $69\\%$ of the complex tables. Regarding FinTabNet, $68\\%$ of the simple and $98\\%$ of the complex tables require the generation of bounding boxes. ",
