	@Terminology Possible API Calls{
		@Terms TextToImage API call: Converts text into images, facilitating the generation of graphical content from textual input.
		@Terms ImageToText API call: Transforms images into text, enabling the extraction of textual information from visual data.
		@Terms SpeechToText API call: Converts spoken language into written text, facilitating applications like voice assistants or transcription services.
		@Terms TextToSpeech API call: Transforms text into spoken language, providing an audio representation of the given textual input for applications like voice interfaces or text-to-speech systems.

	@ContextControl {
		@Rules Maintain context consistency: Ensure that the compilation system can maintain context consistency, that is, the subsequent processing stage is based on the output of the previous stage. Avoid information loss or confusion due to context loss.
		@Rules Carefully examine each "@Command" to determine if it involves calls to the four types of APIs listed in "Possible API Calls". If there are no API calls involved, do not impose API calls unnecessarily.
		@Rules The API categories that may involve Calls are all under "Possible API Calls".


	}
	@Instruction Compiled Natural Language Prompt{
		@Commands Parsing the input: focus only on the @Instruction part and extract "@Command" and "@Rule" for subsequent processing.
		@Commands Processing "@Command" involving API calls:: identify the type of tasks in each "@Command". For "@Command" involving API calls, identify API call keywords, model names, and locate input and output parameters to abstract the generated API call commands.
		@Commands Processing "@Command" without API calls: For "@Command" instances that do not involve API calls, identify the corresponding "@Rule" and add it to the corresponding "@Command" dictionary.
		@Commands Generate dictionaries of "APIcommand" and "NonAPIcommand" : The @APIcommand dictionary contains {"API_Call": "<API Name>", "Content": "< api-command content>"}; @NonAPIcommand dictionary contains {"API_Call": None, "Content": "<NonAPI-command content>", "Rules": ["<Corresponding rules"]}
		@Commands Integrate the "@Rule" of the "@Command" that involves the API call to "APIcommand" dictionary: Extracts restrictions on API calls from rules involving API calls and integrates its information into the corresponding "@Command" to ensure that the generated instructions comply with the corresponding restrictions.
		@Commands Add the "@Rule" of the "@Command" that does not involve the API call to "NonAPIcommand" dictionary: Add these "@Rule", which does not involve API calls to the corresponding "@Command" dictionary's key named "Rules"!
		@Commands Post-processing: Output the generated dictionaries of "APIcommand" and "NonAPIcommand". It must indicate whether it is "@NonAPIcommand" or "@APIcommand" and must override the old "@Command" and "@Rule" in dictionary form.

		@Rules The API categories that may involve Calls are all in "Possible API Calls" section.
		@Rules For all "@Command," they should be either transformed into "@NonAPICommand" dictionaries or converted into "@APICommand" dictionaries. As for all "@Rule," they should either be integrated into the content of the command or become the value of the key "Rules" in the "@NonAPICommand" dictionary.
		@Rules If a command in the input involves multiple API calls, the compiled commands should be divided into multiple commands, each representing the API to be called in order of execution.
		@Rules For compiled commands, a command can contain only one API call.
		@Rules All the "@Rule" instances in the original input will be either added to or integrated into the corresponding commands and will not exist independently.

		@Format{
		    The output should retain its original structure, modify only the "@Instruction" section and output the processed input. For "@Rule" which involves constraint API calls, integrate it into corresponding "@Command"; For "@Rule" where the constraint does not involve calling the API, add it to the corresponding "@Command" dictionary. The modified format of Instruction part is as follows:
            ...(other parts other than Instruction part)
			@Instruction{
                @APIcommand : {"API_Call": "<API Name>", "Content": "<API-command content>"}
                @NonAPIcommand : {"API_Call": "None", "Content": "<NonAPI-command content>", "Rules": ["<Corresponding rules>"]}
            }
            ...(other parts other than Instruction part)

		}
