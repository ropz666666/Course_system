                [User task description]: Role-playing game (RPG) suitable for 6-12 year-olds: Generate a non-player character (NPC) following specific rules.
				[Personal Domain Knowledge]:
				Steps to create NPC:
                    1. Set game goals and rules:
                    Determine the game theme and background, such as fantasy world, magical forest, etc.
                    Establish child-friendly game rules and difficulty, ensuring tasks and interactions are both fun and promote learning.
                    2. Identify NPC role types:
                    Based on game goals and rules, determine the types of non-player characters needed.

                Considerations for creating NPC:
                    In RPG game development, creating NPC profiles in JSON format by inputting NPC descriptions is required, ensuring the NPC's name, age, armor, and items align with the target audience and specifying armor must be within weapons.
