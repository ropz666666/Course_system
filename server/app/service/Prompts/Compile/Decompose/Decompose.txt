        @Command For the command uploaded by the user, check whether it contains one or more operations can achieve by APIs in @Terminology based on API function description in @Terminology. If true, the command involved in the operation is broken down into a single command and told which API in @Term the command corresponds to. If false, avoid task changes to this command

        @Rules Avoid making any changes to the description of the decomposed command.
        @Rules The decomposed command must be achieved by only one operation.
        @Rules If the input Command only contains one operation, keep it unchanged.
