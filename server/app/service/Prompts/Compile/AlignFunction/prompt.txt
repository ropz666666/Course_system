@Terminology Possible API Calls{

    }

@Instruction API Assign {
    @Commands Iterate over @Commands, identifying for each command whether it can be implemented by calling the API in @Terminology Possible API Calls based on each API in @Terminology Possible API Calls and its corresponding function description. If Ture, see the @Commands as APICommand, instead of seeing as NonAPICommand.
    @Commands Generate dictionaries for "APIcommand" and "NonAPIcommand": The "@APIcommand" dictionary contains {"API_Call": "<API Name>", "Content": "<api-command content>"}. The "@NonAPIcommand" dictionary contains {"API_Call": "None", "Content": "<NonAPI-command content>", "Rules": ["<Corresponding rules>"]}.
    @Commands Merge 'APIcommand' and corresponding '@Rule' into a single sentence, and add the sentence to the "APIcommand" dictionary: Extract restrictions on API calls from rules involving API calls and integrate this information into the corresponding "@Command" to ensure that the generated "APIcommand" content complies with the relevant restrictions.
    @Commands Add the "@Rule" of the "@Command" that does not involve the API call to the "NonAPIcommand" dictionary: Include these "@Rule" instances, which do not involve API calls, in the "Rules" key of the corresponding "@NonAPIcommand" dictionary!
    @Commands Post-processing: Output the generated dictionaries of "APIcommand" and "NonAPIcommand." Each entry should clearly indicate whether it belongs to "@NonAPIcommand" or "@APIcommand." Ensure that it overrides the old "@Command" and "@Rule" in dictionary form. Please make sure that the "{{}}" format in the command does not change in your output.

    @Rules The API categories that may involve calls include only in @Terminology Possible API Calls. Please ensure that your output exclusively includes APIs belonging to API in @Terminology Possible API Calls.
    @Rules Carefully analyze each "@Command" to determine the required API calls. If, based on the content of "@Command", it is evident that none of the above types of APIs in "Possible API Calls" need to be called, and instead, other APIs are required, it should be considered as not requiring the invocation of these specific APIs.
    @Rules For all "@Command", they should be either transformed into "@NonAPICommand" dictionaries or converted into "@APICommand" dictionaries. Regarding all "@Rule," they should either be integrated into the content of the command or become the value of the key "Rules" in the "@NonAPICommand" dictionary.
    @Rules All the "@Rule" instances in the original input will either be added to or integrated into the corresponding command dictionaries. After that, discard all "@Rules" items because they are added to or integrated into the corresponding command dictionaries.

    @Format {
        @APIcommand: Generate a dictionary for each "@Command" that involves an API call. This dictionary should include:
            - "API_Call": Specify the API name.
            - "Content": Formulate a single sentence combining the "@Command" content and any relevant "@Rule", ensuring it reflects the specific API requirements and restrictions.

        @NonAPIcommand: For each "@Command" that does not involve an API call, create a dictionary containing:
            - "API_Call": Set as "None".
            - "Content": Include the content of the "@Command".
            - "Rules": List any applicable "@Rule" that governs the execution of the "@Command".
        Ensure every input "@Command" is categorized into either an "@APIcommand" or a "@NonAPIcommand" dictionary. This distinction is vital for clarity in understanding whether an API call is required and which specific API is involved.
        Certainly, please ensure that "@Rules" are not present in your output.
        Make sure that the "{{}}" format does not change.
