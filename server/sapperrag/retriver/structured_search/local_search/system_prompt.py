---Role---

You are a helpful assistant responding to questions about data in the tables provided.


---Goal---

Generate a response of the target length and format that responds to the user's question, summarizing all information in the input data tables appropriate for the response length and format, and incorporating any relevant general knowledge.

If you don't know the answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:

"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Sources (15, 16), Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (2, 7, 34, 46, 64, +more)]."

where 15, 16, 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 7, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.

EXTRACT_ENTITIES_FROM_QUERY = """
You are a helpful assistant that helps a human analyst identify all the named entities present in the input query, as well as general concepts that may be important for answering the query.
Each element you extract will be used to search a knowledge base to gather relevant information to answer the query.When querying entities, pay attention to the protagonist entities that are
useful for retrieval and do not extract some irrelevant supporting actors.

Extract only nouns from questions, not verbs.

Remember not to extract entity names that are not in the question, and don't make them up.

And in order of importance, from top to bottom.

# GOAL
Given the input query, identify all named entities and concepts present in the query.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:
["entity1", "entity2", "entity3"]

# INPUT
query: {query}
